# Integrating Payment Gateway Test Plan

## 1. Introduction & Objective

### Objective
The objective of this test plan is to ensure the successful integration of the third-party payment gateway into the e-commerce platform. This includes verifying that the payment gateway functions as intended, processing payments securely and accurately. Both functional and non-functional requirements will be validated, including:

- Payment processing for various methods (credit cards, debit cards, digital wallets).
- Handling transaction outcomes (success, failure, refunds, chargebacks).
- Verifying performance under normal and peak load conditions.
- Ensuring a seamless and secure user experience during checkout.

### Feature Overview

The third-party payment gateway will be integrated into the e-commerce platform to allow customers to complete transactions using multiple payment methods, such as credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets. The gateway will support payment processing, authentication, and notifications for both successful and failed transactions.

Key integration points include:

- **Checkout Process**: The payment gateway is invoked when users choose to complete a purchase. Payment details are securely collected and sent to the third-party service for authorization.
- **Payment Confirmation**: Upon successful payment, the e-commerce platform receives a confirmation from the gateway and updates the order status.
- **Refunds and Chargebacks**: The system will handle refund requests, sending them to the payment gateway for processing. It will also support chargebacks initiated by customers through their financial institutions.

## 3. Test Strategy

### Test Levels:

- **Integration Testing**: Focus on interactions between the e-commerce platform and the payment gateway, ensuring correct API usage, data flow, and error handling.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Simulate a complete transaction process from adding items to the cart, going through the payment process, and receiving confirmation of a successful or failed payment.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that the payment gateway integration doesn’t impact existing functionalities in the e-commerce platform.

### Testing Types:

- **Functional Testing**: Ensure the basic operations of the payment gateway (payment initiation, payment failure, refund initiation).
- **Negative Testing**: Validate how the system behaves with incorrect inputs (e.g., expired credit card, incorrect card number, insufficient funds).
- **Performance Testing**: Stress-test the system to evaluate the performance of the payment gateway under heavy load or high concurrency scenarios.
- **Security Testing**: Test for vulnerabilities such as data breaches, SQL injections, or man-in-the-middle attacks.

## 4. Test Environment

### Environment Setup:

- **Staging Environment (E-commerce Platform)**:
  - A replica of the production environment will be used to simulate real-world scenarios without impacting live customers.
  - The staging environment will have all the same features, services, and configurations as production, including user accounts, product listings, and order management systems.
  - Security measures such as SSL certificates and encryption will be enabled to closely mirror the live environment.

- **Payment Gateway Sandbox**:
  - The payment gateway provider offers a sandbox environment designed specifically for testing. This environment mimics the behavior of the live gateway but uses test data.
  - The sandbox will support various test scenarios such as successful payments, payment failures, declined transactions, and refunds.
  - API keys for sandbox access will be generated and configured for the staging environment, ensuring secure and reliable communication between the two systems.
  - No real financial transactions will occur, ensuring there’s no risk of impacting actual accounts or financial systems.

### Key Tools:

- API monitoring tools will be set up to track interactions between the e-commerce platform and the sandbox gateway.
- Logs will be enabled to capture detailed information about API requests, responses, and error codes for troubleshooting.

### Test Data:

- **Mock Credit and Debit Card Numbers**: The payment gateway sandbox provides predefined mock credit and debit card numbers for different scenarios (e.g., Visa, MasterCard, Amex).
- **Mock Ideal Payments**: The payment gateway sandbox provides predefined mock ideal payments to test different scenarios.
- **User Data**:
  - Mock Users: A set of test user profiles will be created with different user roles (guest users, registered users, premium users) to simulate different purchasing behaviors.
  - Sensitive Information Handling: Actual user account details, credit card information, and personal data will never be used in testing. Instead, mock data will be generated to ensure privacy and security.

- **Transaction Scenarios**:
  - Low-value Transaction: Simulate small purchases to test typical user behavior for low-value transactions (e.g., less than 100 Euro).
  - High-value Transaction: Test the system’s ability to handle high-value transactions (e.g., 500 - 10000 Euro) and ensure that payment authorization works correctly for larger sums.
  - Refund Scenarios: Simulate both partial and full refunds for transactions, using mock data to ensure refund functionality works across various payment types.
